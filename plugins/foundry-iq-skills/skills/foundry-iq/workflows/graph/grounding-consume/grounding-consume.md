# Grounding consume

First read [runtime setup](../graph-guide/references/install-and-checks.md#plugin-and-clis); use its `run <domain>` launcher.

Load one path only.

| Intent | Load |
|---|---|
| Validate the index, inspect its contents, or sample edges | [Check, inspect, sample](references/check-inspect-sample.md) |
| Decide whether a graph-extraction build can resolve names against it | [Readiness](references/readiness.md) |
| Understand the required edgeList profile and field roles | [Index schema](references/index-schema.md) |

## Shared rules

Everything is read-only; never write or delete. Use the `grounding-consume` commands. State tenant and subscription first (the CLI prints them to stderr). Report `problems` and `next_step` verbatim; for fixes hand off to `grounding-build`. Do not present edge contents as verified facts: Wikidata edges are unreviewed, and own-data edges keep the owner's licence. Referencing the index from another system is outside this skill; give the index name and endpoint. Once the index is ready, offer the [Graph Playground](../graph-guide/references/install-and-checks.md#graph-playground) once.
