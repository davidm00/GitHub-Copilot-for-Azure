# Browse topics

## Quick starts

- "What topics does this corpus cover?"
- "Show me a sitemap of this corpus."
- "List the biggest Topic Graph topics and a few example articles from each."
- "Show me the evidence chunk behind this topic."

## Use this path

Use this path to answer "what is in this corpus?" from a published Topic Graph build, with plain-language topics, sizes, and example articles.

## Flow

Run these commands directly in the main session shell (omit `--descriptor` to use the last published build when only one source is published, or pass `--descriptor <absolute-path>`, which `CURRENT_AMBIGUOUS` requires; endpoint, Entra auth, and tenant hydrate automatically):

1. `topic-graph-consume --json status` returns the topics per level (`topics_per_level`) and `browse_level`, the level with about 10 to 30 topics.
2. `topic-graph-consume --json list-topics` lists that level, largest first. Pass `--level` to go broader (0 is broadest) or more specific, and `--cursor` to page. `--page-size` is 1 to 1,000 (default 100); every command's `--help` lists its defaults, so never read runtime files for them.
3. `topic-graph-consume --json sitemap` returns the whole named hierarchy at once, broadest first, as flat `nodes` with `children` IDs; `--topic <topic-id>` limits it to one branch, `--depth` and `--max-nodes` (default 500) bound it, and `truncated` says when nodes were left out. `coverage` is a topic's share of clustered passages and `parent_coverage` its share of the parent. Version, coverage and build facts under `graph` are null when the build did not record them.
4. `topic-graph-consume --json get-topic <topic-id>` returns one topic with parent and subtopics; page large child lists with `--children-page-size` (default 1,000) and `--children-cursor`. Topic IDs look like `topic:0`.
5. `topic-graph-consume --json list-members <topic-id>` pages through a topic's chunks, closest to the topic's center first (`rank`, `score`); follow `next_cursor` with `--cursor`. At most 1,000 members are listed per topic; `member_count` is the full estimate.
6. `topic-graph-consume --json get-chunk <chunk-id>` returns the chunk text and provenance.

## Answering

- Answer in plain language: topics, sizes, and example articles. Mention topic IDs or levels only when the user drills in.
- Each topic has the name the build gave it (`label`). If `label_status` is `unnamed`, infer a topic from member `source_id` values and say the label is yours.
- Cite a `chunk_id` and `source_id` for every claim; do not summarize documents you did not retrieve.

## Optional Apps

The optional `topicgraph-mcp` adapter requires an Apps-capable session. Only `topicgraph_explore`,
`topicgraph_evidence` and `topicgraph_sitemap` are model-visible presentation entries. Their packaged views use these bounded,
app-only supporting reads:

| UI interaction | Supporting operation |
|---|---|
| Generation health and initial hierarchy | `topicgraph_status` |
| Level selection and topic pagination | `topicgraph_list_topics` |
| Topic detail and subtopic pagination | `topicgraph_get_topic` |
| Member pagination | `topicgraph_app_list_members` |
| Original chunk evidence | `topicgraph_get_chunk` |
| Sitemap outline (explorer Sitemap view and the Sitemap App) | `topicgraph_get_sitemap` |

These reads never embed questions or call a model; members come from a nearest-neighbor read of the source index. Doctor and ordinary consumption stay in the CLI.
Sessions without the Apps capability expose no tools or resources. Missing or altered packaged
assets block startup instead of falling back to a general-purpose server.

## Return

Give the topics with sizes and cited example articles, name the level browsed, and suggest one next drill-down.
