# Entity Graph consume

First read [runtime setup](../graph-guide/references/install-and-checks.md#plugin-and-clis); use its `run <domain>` launcher.

Read-only only.

| Intent | Load |
|---|---|
| Install the CLI, check the descriptor, environment, or advertised capabilities | [Health and capabilities](references/health-and-capabilities.md) |
| Retrieve cited passages; choose lexical or hybrid search | [Document retrieval](references/document-retrieval.md) |
| Traverse relationships, test a premise, answer a set of questions, or explain graph limits | [Graph traversal](references/graph-traversal.md) |

## Shared rules

Use the `entity-graph-consume` CLI with `--json`. Run `entity-graph-consume doctor` before a live query and follow its one `next_step`. `--descriptor` defaults to `ENTITY_DESCRIPTOR`, then the current published descriptor; pass an absolute path when another is intended. A 403 means the caller lacks Search reader access; report the grant guidance instead of retrying.

Never provision, upload, repair, or mutate indexes here. Do not fall back from disabled graph retrieval to document retrieval without saying so. Answer only from returned evidence, check the question's premise first, and cite the returned provenance. After answering, offer the [Graph Playground](../graph-guide/references/install-and-checks.md#graph-playground) once. Never expose secrets or private content beyond the requested evidence. Call the service "Azure AI Search graph queries", never "Graph API" (that is Microsoft Graph).
