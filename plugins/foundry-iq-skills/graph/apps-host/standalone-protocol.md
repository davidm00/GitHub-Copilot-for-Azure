# Protocol, tool policy and resource bounds

Client, core and Apps SDK versions are pinned by `package-lock.json` and recorded in
build provenance as `sdkVersions`. The public client option is
`versionNegotiation: {mode: {pin: "2026-07-28"}}`. Initialization checks both
the negotiated MCP revision and the server-returned supported versions; legacy
fallback is disabled. The Apps extension protocol is separately `2026-01-26`.
The SDK supplies MCP negotiation, per-request client context, cancellation and
JSON-RPC correlation; the official AppBridge supplies App protocol correlation.

Only the canonical presenters and supporting reads are permitted:

| Domain | Presentation tools | App-only supporting reads |
|---|---|---|
| Ontology | `ontology_present`, `ontology_present_evidence` | `ontology_show`, `ontology_evidence` |
| Entity Graph | `entity_present`, `entity_present_evidence` | `entity_graph_query`, optional `entity_hydrate_grounding` and `entity_graph_counts` |
| Topic Graph | `topicgraph_explore`, `topicgraph_evidence` | `topicgraph_status`, `topicgraph_list_topics`, `topicgraph_get_topic`, `topicgraph_app_list_members`, `topicgraph_get_chunk`, `topicgraph_get_sitemap`, optional `topicgraph_nearest_chunks` |
| Grounding | `grounding_present` | `grounding_overview`, `grounding_search` |

Support calls retain an opaque App session bound to the originating server and
original query/scope. Entity full-provenance reads cannot change query, query mode, topic diversity, top, depth
or fanout. Topic exploration selects the passages nearest the topic's centroid (default 100) and
hands their IDs and source identity to Entity Graph as `chunk_scope`. Full reads
retain that exact scope; topic labels do not drive retrieval.
Tool visibility is checked; missing required supporting tools prevent
startup. There are no write, provisioning or model tools in the host allowlist.

Default request deadlines are 30 seconds. Entity may explicitly use `timeoutMs`
1..120000; ontology/Topic Graph/grounding remain 1..30000. The same configured deadline bounds HTTP
work and official SDK requests. Cancellation/expiry retires the owning MCP
connection and stops its owned Windows process tree; reconnect is then required.
Other server connections are independent. Four concurrent HTTP operations,
16-KiB ordinary requests (1 MiB, enforced while streaming, for validated Entity reads scoped to topic passages),
4-MiB responses, 3-MiB App documents, a 64-KiB server diagnostic tail,
32 open Apps and 10,000 request IDs per launch bound resources.

Stderr is continuously drained, not capped over the server's lifetime. Ordinary
successful reads may cumulatively emit more than 64 KiB. Only the latest 64 KiB
is retained privately; startup/exit/failure metadata reports total, retained and
truncated byte counts. Raw text is never sent to the browser or routine logs;
failed SDK errors carry a non-enumerable `diagnosticTail` for local debugging.
A per-connection token bucket permits a 1-MiB burst and replenishes at 256 KiB/s.
Exceeding that rate closes only the noisy connection with an explicit diagnostic
burst error and requires reconnect. This bounds abusive output without treating
normal accumulated Azure HTTP INFO diagnostics as a server failure.
